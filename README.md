# 🎨 Color Harmonization

This is a full-stack project with a **React** frontend and a **Node.js** backend.

---

## 📦 Installation

Install dependencies for both the client and server:

```bash
# Install frontend dependencies
cd client/
npm install

# Install backend dependencies
cd ../server/
npm install
```

---

## 🚀 Running the Project

Use two separate terminal windows to run the client and server:

### Start the Frontend (React)

```bash
cd client/
npm start
```

By default, this will open the app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Start the Backend (Node.js)

```bash
cd server/
node index.js
```

By default, the server runs at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) (or whatever port is specified in `index.js`).
